# ray-tracer

Working on a ray tracer in Scala.

Update: Created function to detect first in a list of geometries

0.0.4: Sphere intersection now works as expected.

0.0.3: Added sphere class and sphere intersection test. It appears to work but the intersection points are extremely large for some reason.

0.0.2: Currently have the plane-ray intersection function working just fine.
